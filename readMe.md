add new idea locally functional
add new idea remote submission

shuffle card order

Roadmap:
v1 - likes, dislikes, local storage saving, new idea submission
v2 - categories
v3 - more settings

- show all ideas currently in state (dont filter in page)
- need to manage liked/disliked ideas separately in state - maybe {[id]:{sentiment: 0}}
